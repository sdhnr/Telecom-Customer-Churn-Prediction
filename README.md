# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

Predict customer churn in the telecom industry and improve customer retention using machine learning.

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn, a critical business metric for telecom service providers. Customer churn, also known as attrition, refers to customers leaving the service. Identifying at-risk customers and retaining them is essential for maintaining a healthy customer base and maximizing revenue.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. You can access it by following this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/telecom-customer-churn-by-maven-analytics/code).

The dataset contains comprehensive customer information, service usage, billing details, and churn status. You can download it from Kaggle and place it in the `data` directory.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** We clean, preprocess, and explore the dataset to prepare it for modeling.

2. **Feature Engineering:** We create relevant features and select the most influential ones.

3. **Model Building:** We experiment with various machine learning algorithms and optimize the best-performing model.

4. **Model Evaluation:** We evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

5. **Deployment:** The best model is deployed for real-time predictions.

## Results

My predictive model achieves high accuracy and provides insights into factors influencing churn. This helps proactively reduce churn rates and improve customer satisfaction.
